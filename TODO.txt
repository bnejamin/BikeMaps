##### TO DO

### GENERAL SITE UPDATES
  # HIGHER PRIORITY
    * Migrate database to use model inheritance (almost complete)
    * Track down memory/DOM issues causing site load problems
    * Fix ICBC loading problems
    * Serve some pages over http to get around unsafe site resources warnings (do during new server setup since this will have to be configured then anyway)
    * Setup new server
    * Add "Contact Us" navbar link - dependent on use of AJAX to avoid redirects
    * Colour report buttons / make them more obvious
    * /stats page navbar link
    * /recent page navbar link (maybe instead of alerts bell?)
    * "Why we need personal details" button/popup on report form
    * Blog app with built in content management system for easy updating (ie like wordpress WYSIWYG system)
    * Terms and Conditions update regarding new display of details information
    * Add Karen safety information
    * Cleanup index.html code
    * Cleanup stats.html code a lot ****

  # LOWER PRIORITY
    * Open311 data sharing
    * Display open street map (OSM) bike lanes and bike racks on main map
    * Automate monthly emails of stats page
    * Option to report for different person
    * Vertical center sponsors and supporters images
    * Allow admin point moving on main map page
    * OAuth2 (Facebook Google+) login options
    * Prevent user from having to sign in everytime (via cookies?)
    * opt in for emails (double opt in if possible)
    * Search engine optimization ie keywords as meta tags?
    * Documentation for future devs
    * Make use of AJAX to prevent unnecessary page redirects (eg when submitting a point, eliminate redirect to index page)
    * improve incidents heatmap
    * Clear all button in alerts "mark all as read"
    *	Intersection search
    *	Linking the occurrence of a near-miss, crash, and theft to weather (Automatically added using http get request from RSS?)
    *	Alert emails to include graphics
    * Improve search (text hard to read, Android problems?)


### HAZARDS MODEL UPDATES
  * Severity rating
  * Short term hazards auto resolve and removed from map (ie weather hazards disappear after 1 day)
  * Long term hazards (eg road condition) can be removed by privileged users (eg municipal workers)
  * Remove injury field



### MOBILE WISH LIST
  * Figure out framework to use for cross platform app
  * Fullscreen on mobile (figure out how to get rid of address bar in browser, probably via scrolling page automatically on some button click)
  * Hazard photos (mobile app)
  * Route tracking (mobile app)
  * Real time updates of hazards in riding area (mobile app)
  * Mobile hazard area creation (this currently can only be done on non-touchscreen devices)
  * Safest route finding algorithm and visualization



### BUGS
  * Broken modal popups on some browsers
  * Moderate comments > delete button not working
  * Date picker does not scroll with modal (bind to something?)
  * Leaflet draw does not work for mobile (currently using double tap work-around for mobile)
  * Some users reporting blank screen on browsing to site (Probably a non-webkit browser issue that can't be fixed without updating browser/OS older than Windows XP, display error message)
